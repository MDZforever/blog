I am Ananda Seelan and this is my blog *(or rather just a list of interesting things that I would like to note down for myself or a few others who might find it interesting)*. You can find the actual [blog entries in the Issues tab of this repo](https://github.com/scarecrow1123/blog/issues). Each blog is labelled and hence can be filtered with tags linked [below](https://github.com/scarecrow1123/blog/blob/master/README.md#tags-----gatech-omscs-----python). Links for individual blog entry is listed in the [ToC](https://github.com/scarecrow1123/blog/blob/master/README.md#table-of-contents).

##### A note on using Github issues for writing a blog
Whilst I started writing by using only README.md, I stumbled upon [Luke Gorrie's blog](https://github.com/lukego/blog) where this style was being followed. It never occurred to me that Github Issues has all the features necessary for maintaining a blog until I saw Luke's repo! Some of the stuff necessary for a blog that are available here:

* Adding reactions to a post(issues)
* Discussions through commenting on posts
* Get notified of new stuff by "Watching" this repository
* Or just bookmark it by "Star"ring this repository
* Categorize posts using "Labels"
* Search
